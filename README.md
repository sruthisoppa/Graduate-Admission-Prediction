# 🎓 Graduate Admission Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the probability of a candidate getting admission into a graduate program. It considers various academic and profile-based factors to output a percentage chance of admission.

## 📊 Dataset Features

- GRE Score (out of 340)
- TOEFL Score (out of 120)
- University Rating (1 to 5)
- Statement of Purpose Strength (1 to 5)
- Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)
- CGPA (out of 10)
- Research Experience (0 or 1)

## 🚀 Model Used

- Linear Regression (can be extended to others)
- Feature scaling and correlation analysis included

## 📌 Goals

- Understand the impact of different features on admission chances
- Predict admission likelihood using historical data
- Help students identify areas of improvement

## 📁 Files Included

- `Graduate_Admission_prediction.ipynb`: Complete notebook with data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Try other models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Add web UI for user input and prediction
